# Manim Presentation

The code in this repository was made as part of the EDM009815 (Technic and cientific communication) course of UNESP (Universidade Estadual Paulista) by Dante Escame, Gabriel Tetzlaf, Gustavo Manarim and Pedro Potenza. For this project we choose to tell some of the story behind the beloved python lib Manim. 
This repository contains the code to generate all scenes used in the slides commited here.

## Generating the scenes

First you need to have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Manim](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html) installed in your machine. After you installed both, you can run the project using Manim's CLI

```bash
manim render main.py
```

## Usage

After generating the scenes in the step below, you'll be able to access all them at the media folder
```bash
media/videos/MainTitleScene.mp4
```
